<h2>To Prospective Students</h2>
<h4>Last update: 11/2024</h4>

<br>
I want to be a great advisor and believe that this can only happen if and only if:

<ul>
<li>there is significant overlap between what you and I are excited about. So please take a look at my <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/">research group page</a>, and think about what you feel passionate and highly motivated to work on. Your interests should align, or better yet, <b>expand mine</b>: one of the best things about being in graduate school is that you get to teach others knowledge that, before you, have never been discovered, and I am eager to learn from you things that I've never heard/thought of before.

<li>we actually like each other as well as what we are doing. To figure this out, we should communicate, and hopefully work together, before you fully join my group. The <b>best way</b> to do this is to start some informal collaboration before you apply/join. This can be taking on a small project of mutual interests or discussing papers you've been reading.
</ul>

<hr width=50%>
<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>
<p>
Ultimately, our research mission is to 1) discover new sciences so we understand things that we previously don't, 2) build new engineering systems to do things that we previously couldn't, and 3) express art and comprehend art history through computational approaches.
</p>

<p>
Concretely, we do research at the intersection of imaging (optics + image sensors), cognition/perception (psychophysics and computational modeling), and computer systems (computer architecture and programming model).  A common tool underlying many of our explorations is deep learning.
</p>

<p>
Below is a partial list of things that we are currently exploring:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/art.html">Computational art</a>: expressing visual arts, comprehending art history, and exploring aesthetics (if you find <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2011927117">some of</a> <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11894">these</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-023-00212-w">papers</a>  interesting and/or aren't completely convinved by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00218/full">this paper</a>, let me know! if you are an artist and/or have worked in an art studio, definitely reach out!!)
  <li> Understanding and modeling human visual system to build efficient Augmented and Virtual Reality devices (e.g., color perception-driven <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/sa22.pdf">display</a> and <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/asplos24-vr.pdf">memory compression</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00435">foveated neural rendering</a>).
  <li> Deep learning-inspired neuroscience and neuroscience-inspired deep learning.
  <li> Computer systems for robotics and Embodied AI (see our prior work on <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/am.html">robotic computing systems</a>).
  <li> Tools/frameworks for automating computer architecture design and exploration (e.g., automatically <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/isca23-imagen.pdf">inserting buffers</a> in image processing accelerators, synthesizing robotic <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/micro21.pdf">localization accelerators</a>, accelerator design space exploration for <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/micro19-tigris.pdf">neighbor search</a> and <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/isca14.pdf">Web applications</a>).
  <li> Assistive technologies (e.g., AR/VR-based) to augment human (visual) perception (e.g., <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/uist24.pdf">computational treatment of color vision deficiency</a>).
  <li> Efficient and environment-friendly image sensing systems (see our <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/isca23-camj.pdf">modeling tool</a> and a bespoke <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/isca24-blisscam.pdf">eye-tracking sensor architecture</a> and <a href="https://horizon-lab.org/pubs/vr22.pdf">algorithm</a>).
  <li> Optical computing stack for brain-scale simulation and computing.
</ul>

<h3>What We Are Looking For</h3>

<p>
We welcome students with a diverse background even if your formative education does not involve extensive programming. Over the year we've worked with students with backgrounds in physical sciences, math, psychology, archaeology, and arts.
</p>

<p>
In general, your experience will be much more positive if you are interested/had experience in at least <i>one of</i> the following, <i>in addition to</i> having solid programming skills (C/C++, Python, deep learning frameworks):
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Deep learning (hands-on experience beyond course projects on, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model">foundation models</a>)
  <li> Optics (basic geometrical optics and Fourier optics at an undergraduate level; equivalent of Hecht's <a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/optics/P200000006793?view=educator">Optics</a>)
  <li> Human vision (undergraduate intro-level class on perception and cognition, e.g., Sensation and Perception by Yantis and Abrams or by Goldstein; I encourage you to read Brian Wandell's <a href="https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu/">Foundations of Vision</a>)
  <li> Computer graphics (e.g., both conventional rasterization/path tracing and recent neural rendering)
  <li> Computer vision (not deep learning, but knowledge equivalent to what Shree Nayar teaches in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@firstprinciplesofcomputerv3258/videos">First Principles of Computer Vision</a>; pay close attention to early lectures on image formation)
  <li> Engineering math (equivalent to what Steve Brunton teaches in these online courses: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNT_Xh3Oy0Y4LTj0Oxo8GqsC">Fourier Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNTYaOnVI3QpH7jgULnAmvPA">Dynamical Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNRHP5UA-gIimsXLQyHXxRty">Sparsity and Compression</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNSVjnsviglFoY2nXildDCcv">Matrix Methods</a> as well as Optimization equivalent to UR's <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/gildea/2014_Fall/">CSC 577</a>)
  <li> Computer systems (e.g., having done a pedagogical CPU on FPGA or developed a pedagogical compiler)
  <li> Hands-on hardware engineering skills (equivalent of designing and building this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Image-Sensor-and-Digital-Camera/">DIY camera</a>)
</ul>

<p>I encourage you to go over the <a href="https://cs.rochester.edu/courses/572/fall2022/schedule.html">slides</a> of our visual computing course.</p>

<h3>Mentoring Philosophy</h3>
<p> As your advisor, I will help you adopt the <b>IDEAL</b> research methodology: Identification, Definition, Exploration, Assessment, and Learning.</p>

<p><u class="ideal">IDENTIFICATION</u>. Identifying a research topic is the first step for you. I believe good research topics should have both real-world impact and scientific merits. One effective approach to identifying such research topics is to spare some time everyday reading technology websites and news articles (e.g., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web</a>). The focus is to identify issues that the general public care about (and thus have broad impact) and to think about what scientific and technical breakthroughs are needed to address those issues (your potential research topic!).</p>

<p><u class="ideal">DEFINITION</u>. Clearly defining the problem scope, after identifying a research
topic, is vital to any research
projects. In my observations, the single most expensive mistake that graduate
students tend to make is skipping
the scope definition step and jumping to the solution exploration step too
quickly. Often, it leads to months of
time wasted on searching solutions to an “undefined” problem. I will help you develop problem definition skills:
if the problem identified is too specific, generalize it and scope the
problem in a broader context; if the
problem identified is too big, break it down into multiple smaller problems
where each has a clear scope.</p>

<p><u class="ideal">EXPLORATION</u>. Exploring creative solutions is what we all enjoy as scientists and
engineers. I believe <b><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/to-get-more-creative-become-less-productive">creativity can be trained</a></b>. Many psychology studies have shown that creativity comes from
the reuse of ideas, or in other words, to take ideas that have worked well in one context and apply it by analogy
to another context. A creative solution is nothing more than the juxtaposition of a particular idea in a particular
context that people have never though of before.<p>

<p>To freely “reuse” ideas, however, one must master a lot of
ideas. That is, to be able to "think out of the box", <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/how-you-define-the-problem-determines-whether-you-solve-it">you first need to have a big box</a>! I will encourage you to extensively read papers, particularly those that are not directly related to your current research, to create an idea repository that your future projects can borrow from.</p>

<p>
<u class="ideal">ASSESSMENT</u>. Assessing the practicality of a solution is particularly important to architecture and systems research. I will
encourage you to assess solutions not only under the constraints of today’s technology, but also to consider
future technology scaling so as to create systems that have a long-term impact.
</p>

<p>
<u class="ideal">LEARNING</u>. The research loop is never closed without learning from the success and failure of the past. I will help you
deliver good research talks as it is an important way for learning. A good talk usually means positive and
insightful feedbacks, which motivate better research.

<h3>Send an Email</h3>

If you've made this far, feel free to send me an email telling us why your interests align with ours and how you can contribute. Ideally, you will have read one of our recent papers and tell us what you think, e.g., insights you learn from the paper, things that you are not convinced, how you would have done things differently, etc.
