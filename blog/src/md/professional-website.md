# On Having a “Professional” Personal Website
*Aug 16, 2014*

My advisor was (co)charing CGO’2014, and he asked me to compile an email list of all the authors who published at ISCA, MICRO, HPCA, and ASPLOS over the last three years, so that the publicity chair and he could send out the “spam bomb” to publicize CGO.

It took me 10 mins to compile a list of all the names; the tedious and intimidating part was to find the email address for each of them. I could not think of an automatic way other than to google the name, go to the webpage, and look for the email address. It was amazing to me how difficult it was on some webpages to find a single email address, or in general, to quickly locate important information.

I think the purpose of a personal webpage is to **publicize yourself**, i.e., to help other people know you. Therefore, it is critical to have important information upfront instead of overwhelming people with gazillions of details. Throughout the searching process, I found the following very helpful for me to quickly know a person:

* Make your webpage fast to load. Do not use terrible templates that run excessively long JavaScript code before rendering the webpage.
* Always have the contact information, most importantly the email address, immediately noticeable.
* It is understandable to use dot for . and at for @ or even more fantastic representations to prevent spams. But at least create a mailto link that contains the actual email address for people to easily grab (most Web browsers will create a “Copy Email Address” right-click shortcut for such links). I understand that this is again vulnerable to spam crawlers, but you should ease your visitors as much as possible, and swallow the bitter pill and take the grind to deal with spams.
* For each of your paper, try create a separate webpage — different from the PDF file link — that contains the concise information of the paper. Very often people are just trying to grab the BiBTex, look for the corresponding author information, or read the abstract before deciding to download a few MB of the PDF file.
